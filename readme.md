# Focus Tracker

## Project Structure

`main-alpha-v0.02.py` is a simple implementation of the `FocusTracker` backgroud runner that collects data of the users such as which and when the app or url(if it is a browser) they are using. it stores the data at `/data/local/[date].csv`

### Micro

small micro programms that might be related to `focusTracker`

### Macro

`frontend/alpha-v0.01` -> at present it is just a next js web demo which will not that good looking but i plan to convert this into a electron code if ui is good.


### data

`data/icon/[name].exe.png` automatically fetched from the executables
`data/local` stores the data for the activity
